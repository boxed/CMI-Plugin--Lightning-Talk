CMI Plugin: Lightning-Talk
==========================

This is the CMi plugin I used to present CMi in my Lightning Talk at Europython 2013. To use it in CMi
put this code into a folder called "presentation" in ~/Library/Application Support/CMi/plugins like this:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/CMi/
mkdir plugins
cd plugins
git clone git@github.com:boxed/CMI-Plugin--Lightning-Talk.git presentation
````
